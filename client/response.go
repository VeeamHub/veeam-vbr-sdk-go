/*
 * Veeam Backup & Replication REST API
 *
 * This document lists paths (endpoints) of the Veeam Backup & Replication REST API and operations that you can perform by sending HTTP requests to the paths.<br> Requests can contain parameters in their path, query and header. POST and PUT requests can include a request body with resource payload. In response, you receive a conventional HTTP response code, HTTP response header and an optional response body schema that contains a result model.<br> Parameters, request bodies, and response bodies are defined inline or refer to schemas defined globally. Some schemas are polymorphic.
