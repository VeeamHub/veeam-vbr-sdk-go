/*
Veeam Backup & Replication REST API

This document lists paths (endpoints) of the Veeam Backup & Replication REST API and operations that you can perform by sending HTTP requests to the paths.<br>Requests can contain parameters in their path, query and header. POST and PUT requests can include a request body with resource payload. In response, you receive a conventional HTTP response code, HTTP response header and an optional response body schema that contains a result model.<br> Some request and response bodies refer to reusable schema objects that are defined in the `schemas` section of the REST API specification. Schemas, in turn, may inherit a part of their properties by referring to other schemas, and be polymorphic by referring to multiple alternate schemas.
